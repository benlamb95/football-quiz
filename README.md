# Welcome to my Football quiz in Python!

## Introduction
---


Football is one of my true passions in life and attending quiz nights is another; so what better to combine them both and create a python game which will help with my personal development using the python language?! \
And count towards my third Project Milestone with Code Institute.

The [Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/) is the most watched league in the world as it is the most challenging and competitive. So with this quiz I to hope it will be challenging but fun!
