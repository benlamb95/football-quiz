# Welcome to my Football quiz in Python!

## Introduction
---


Football is one of my true passions in life and attending quiz nights is another; so what better to combine them both and create a python game which will help with my personal development using the python language?! \
And count towards my third Project Milestone with Code Institute.

The [Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/) is the most watched league in the world as it is the most challenging and competitive. So with this quiz I to hope it will be challenging but fun!

## UX
### Site Goals
* To provide a fun quiz game that resides within a python Terminal
* To provide users an easy to use and follow page structure with simple commands
* To provide users feedback for both correct and incorrect answers as well as incorrect commands; producing error messages.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
