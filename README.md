# Welcome to my Football quiz in Python!

## Introduction
---


Football is one of my true passions in life and attending quiz nights is another; so what better to combine them both and create a python game which will help with my personal development using the python language?! \
And count towards my third Project Milestone with Code Institute.

The [Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/) is the most watched league in the world as it is the most challenging and competitive. So with this quiz I to hope it will be challenging but fun!

## UX
### Site Goals
* To provide a fun quiz game that resides within a python Terminal
* To provide users an easy to use and follow page structure with simple commands
* To provide users feedback for both correct and incorrect answers as well as incorrect commands; producing error messages.

### Site Goals
* As a user I want to play a fun quiz game that is fun.
* As a user I want the questions to have ranging difficulty.
* As a user I want to be able to check my scores.
* As a user I want there to be a consistent theme and language used.

## Testing 
Testing was done through out the development of this quiz via the terminal in Gitpod. This project was easier to test as it runs through a terminal any way so all that was required was to test functions 
by calling them and adding print statements. The longest inital stage of testing was seeing whether or not the scores/points acquired by the user would add correctly to the spreadsheet.
